    text: `Eating a balanced, healthy diet can help you manage gestational diabetes. The diet recommendations that follow are for women with gestational diabetes who do NOT take insulin.
    For a balanced diet, you need to eat a variety of healthy foods. Reading food labels can help you make healthy choices when you shop.
    If you are a vegetarian or on a special diet, talk with your health care provider to make sure you're getting a balanced diet.
    In general, you should eat:
    ·  	Plenty of whole fruits and vegetables
    ·  	Moderate amounts of lean proteins and healthy fats
    ·  	Moderate amounts of whole grains, such as bread, cereal, pasta, and rice, plus starchy vegetables, such as corn and peas
    ·  	Fewer foods that have a lot of sugar, such as soft drinks, fruit juices, and pastries
    Being a woman,you should start taking a folic acid supplement even when you’re not trying to get pregnant as iron counts as a very essential diet supplement throughout the women’s life.
    For the entire duration of their pregnancy, women must avoid consuming raw or partially cooked eggs, including dishes that may contain them. Raw or partially cooked eggs may contain a dangerous bacteria called salmonella. This bacteria may cause intrauterine infections, severe enough to provoke miscarriages.
     Do not skip meals and snacks. Keep the amount and types of food (carbohydrates, fats, and proteins) about the same from day to day. This can help you keep your blood sugar stable. The most important thing to do before food shopping is testing yourself for food allergies and intolerances. Allergies can be very dangerous but last a short period of time, whilst intolerances can affect your body in a bad way for many days.

    text: `Glucose, galactose, and fructose are common monosaccharides, whereas common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose.
    Monosaccharides, also called simple sugar, are the simplest form of sugar and the most basic units of carbohydrates.
    Starch and glycogen, examples of polysaccharides, are the storage forms of glucose in plants and animals, respectively.
    ·  	Less than half the calories you eat should come from carbohydrates.
    ·  	Most carbohydrates are found in starchy or sugary foods. They include bread, rice, pasta, cereal, potatoes, peas, corn, fruit, fruit juice, milk, yogurt, cookies, candy, soda, and other sweets.
    ·  	High-fiber, whole-grain carbohydrates are healthy choices. These types of carbohydrates are called complex carbohydrates.
    ·  	Try to avoid eating simple carbohydrates, such as potatoes, french-fries, white rice, candy, soda, and other sweets. This is because they cause your blood sugar to rise quickly after you eat such foods.
    
    ·  	Vegetables are good for your health and your blood sugar. Enjoy lots of them.
    ·  	Carbohydrates in food are measured in grams. You can learn to count the amount of carbohydrates in the foods that you eat.

    Since fried foods are cooked in oil at extremely high temperatures, they are likely to contain trans fats. In fact, trans fats are associated with an increased risk of many diseases, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity (6, 7 , 8).`,
